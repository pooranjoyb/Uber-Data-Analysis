# Uber Data Analysis of 2016
This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring the Uber data from the year 2016. The notebook provides valuable insights into the rides taken by Uber users, including information about the busiest months, overall distances covered by drivers, analysis of different visited places, visualizations for various travel purposes, and correlations between time traveled and distance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be found on Kaggle. You can access the dataset through the following link:

#### [Kaggle Dataset: Uber Data Analysis 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/uberdrives)
Please download the dataset from the above link and ensure it is placed in the appropriate directory as specified in the code.
#### Notebook link: The Jupyter Noteboo for the same can found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pooranjoyb/uber-data-analysis)

## Tasks Performed
- **Busiest Month Analysis:** The code includes an analysis of the busiest month in the year 2016 for Uber. This analysis provides insights into the periods when Uber experienced high demand and activity.
- **Overall Distances Covered by User Drivers:** The code calculates and presents the overall distances covered by Uber drivers throughout the year. This analysis sheds light on the total distance traveled by drivers and helps understand the scale of Uber's operations.
- **Distance Analysis:** The code performs an in-depth analysis of distances covered by Uber rides. It explores statistical measures, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to understand the distribution and variability of distances traveled by users.
- **Analysis of Different Visited Places:** This analysis focuses on the places frequently visited by Uber users. The code provides insights into the most popular destinations, enabling us to identify areas with high user demand.
- **Visualization of Travels for Different Purposes:** The code creates visualizations to showcase the number of travels based on different purposes, such as commuting, leisure, or business. These visualizations offer a comprehensive view of the reasons behind Uber rides.
- **Correlations for Time Traveled and Distance:** The code explores correlations between the time traveled and the distance covered. This analysis helps understand the relationship between these two variables and provides insights into travel patterns.
